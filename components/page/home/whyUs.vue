            Defining competitive marketplaces involves tracking and studying
            anonymous consumer populations as they move from location to
            location.

            Our unique engagements data access to anonymized GPS data reveals
            locations consumers have visited from their residence. We are then
            able to use a variety of 3rd party sources to learn who these
            consumers are, and what they are interested in.
