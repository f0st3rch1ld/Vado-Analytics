          You are not the only one who defines your marketplace. Competition
          determines how far people are willing to come to you, how they prefer
          you compared to your competitors, and the approach to capture
          marketshare.<br /><br />
          Know how you stack up against your competitors, where to gain
          marketshare, and the optimal marketing plans to grow your business.
